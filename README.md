# New Relic Logs for Salesforce Commerce Cloud

A Docker image purpose-built to monitor Salesforce Commerce Cloud (fka Demandware) logs using New Relic Logs.

This image contains 2 processes to collect, process and send these logs to New Relic:
  * [cctail](https://github.com/openmindlab/cctail) - a node.js app used to tail and consolidate logs from any SFCC host via WebDAV.
  * [FluentD](https://www.fluentd.org) - an open source data collector for unified logging layer.
    * [fluent-plugin-newrelic](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/enable-log-management-new-relic/enable-log-monitoring-new-relic/fluentd-plugin-log-forwarding) - New Relic's official FluentD plugin to send log events to the New Relic Logs endpoint.
    * [fluent-grok-parser](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-plugin-grok-parser) - Fluentd's official plugin that enables Logstash's Grok-like parsing logic.

## Installation

1. Use `git` to clone this repository into a suitable folder:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/newrelic-experimental/newrelic-logs-for-salesforce-commerce-cloud.git nr-logs-for-sfcc
```
2. Use `docker` to build a container from this image:
```sh
docker build -t 'nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest' ./nr-logs-for-sfcc
```

## Usage

1. Get the [License Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#license-key) for your account, which can be found [here](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/api-keys-ui.api-keys-launcher)
2. Use the following docker command to run your container.
```sh
docker run -d -e "NEWRELIC_API_KEY=<your_license_key>" -e "SFCC_HOSTNAME=<your_sfcc_host>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_ID=<your_sfcc_client_id>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_sfcc_client_secret>" nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```
* If you prefer to store these environment variables in a file like [this example](./sfcc.env), you can run docker like so:
```sh
docker run -d --env-file=sfcc.env nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```
3. Login to New Relic and open the [Logs UI](https://one.newrelic.com/launcher/logger.log-launcher), look for entries with `sfcc.xxxx` as their service_name.

## Troubleshooting

If you are not seeing any logs in New Relic Logs:
1. _Wait a few minutes!_ As there are a couple steps between your logs and New Relic, it can take a few minutes for them to start rolling in, especially if you have many different log types or high log volumes.
2. Connect to your docker container at command-line and review the logs. All of the pertinent logs (`cctail.log`, `fluentd.log` and `supervisord.log`) are found in the root directory. The following example also shows how to get the container ID easily and re-use that for connecting:
```sh
thiscontainer=$(docker ps | grep nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest | head -n1 | awk '{print $1;}')
docker exec -t -i $thiscontainer /bin/sh
```

  * What each log will tell you:
    * `fluentd.log` - issues with the New Relic License Key or log parsing rules. Messages like `[error]: #0 Response was 403 {}` indicate an invalid or unset key.
    * `cctail.log` - issues with your SFCC credentials.
    * `supervisord.log` - container-wide issues, i.e. those caused by changes made to `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh` or `supervisord.conf`.
3. You can run cctail in Debug Mode, using the `CCTAIL_ARGS` environment variable at `docker run` time. This will send more information into `cctail.log` about what logs are being polled, and how many log records are being reported from each.
```sh
docker run -d -e "CCTAIL_ARGS=-d" -e "NEWRELIC_API_KEY=<your_license_key>" -e "SFCC_HOSTNAME=<your_sfcc_host>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_ID=<your_sfcc_client_id>" -e "SFCC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_sfcc_client_secret>" nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```
or (if using an env file):
```sh
docker run -d -e "CCTAIL_ARGS=-d" -env-file=sfcc.env nr-logs-for-sfcc:latest
```
